              Andolina: Types of Soil​
            </h2>
            <p>
              Soil is one of the most important elements in creating a successful landscape. It provides the foundation for plants to grow and helps anchor them in place. There are many different types of soil, each with its unique characteristics. Knowing which type of soil you have is the first step in determining what plants will be best suited for your landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are three major types of soil: sand, clay, and loam. All soil is a mixture of these three components in different proportions. The ratio of these components will determine the texture, porosity, and drainage of the soil.
            </p>
            <p>
              -Sand: Sand is the largest particle size of the three soil types. It has good drainage but is not very fertile. Sandy soils are often light in color and feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          -Clay: Clay is the smallest particle size of the three soil types. It has poor drainage but is very fertile. Clay soils are often dark in color and feel sticky when rubbed between your fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          -Loam: Loam is a mix of sand, clay, and organic matter. It has good drainage and is very fertile. Loam soils are often dark in color and feel spongy when rubbed between your fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organic matter, such as compost or peat moss, can be added to all types of soil to improve drainage and fertility. No matter what type of soil you have, adding organic matter will help your plants thrive.

              Andolina: Mulch and Topsoil​
            </h2>
            <p>
              Mulch is a protective layer that is spread on the top of the soil. It helps keep the soil moist, reduces weed growth, and gives your garden a finished look. Topsoil is the uppermost layer of soil that is rich in nutrients and ideal for growing plants.
            </p>
            <p>
              Andolina Materials offers a variety of topsoil and mulch products to meet your landscaping needs. Our topsoil is ideal for gardens, lawns, and flower beds. It is a perfect base for new plantings, and can also be used to fill in low areas or level out uneven ground.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Landscaping is an important part of any property. It can add aesthetic value, provide privacy, and even increase the value of a home. When it comes to landscaping materials, there are three main options: stone, pavers, and brick. Each has its unique benefits and drawbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stone is perhaps the most natural-looking material for landscaping. It can be used for everything from walkways to walls to ponds. Stone is also one of the most durable materials available, making it perfect for high-traffic areas. However, it can be quite expensive and difficult to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pavers are made from concrete or plastic and come in a variety of shapes and colors. They are relatively inexpensive compared to stone and are easy to install. However, they are not as durable as a stone and can be damaged by weathering or heavy traffic.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Brick is another popular choice for landscaping materials. It is durable and long-lasting, but also quite expensive. Brick can be used for everything from walls to driveways to patios. It comes in a variety of colors and styles, allowing you to create a custom look for your property.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter which material you choose, be sure to consult with a professional landscaper to ensure that it is the best choice for your property.

          Andolina: Decorative Gravel
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
          Decorative gravel is a popular addition to landscaping because it can add color and texture to gardens and yards. It can also be used to create paths, walkways, and driveways. There are many different types of decorative gravel available, so it is important to choose the right type for your project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common type of decorative gravel is pea gravel. Pea gravel is small, round stones that are typically about the size of a pea. They are available in a variety of colors, including white, black, gray, and tan. Pea gravel is often used as a ground cover in landscaping because it stays in place well and does not need to be replaced often.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another popular type of decorative gravel is river rock. River rock is larger than pea gravel and comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. It is available in many natural colors, including white, black, gray, brown, and red. River rock is often used to create water features such as ponds and waterfalls. It can also be used to build walls and walkways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Granite is another type of decorative gravel that is popular in landscaping. Granite comes in a variety of colors, including white, black, gray, pink, and blue. It is available in both small and large sizes. Granite is often used to create pathways, patios, and driveways.
